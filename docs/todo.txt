QuDos TODO list.
==============================================================================

* Fix unnedded sign differences in structures.
* Fix byte - char differences.
* Fix possible buffer overflow in all configstrings.
* Add buffer size parameter to all functions that output a string.
* Merge Com_Printf() like functions (variations) whenever possible.
* Use enumerations instead of macros for arguments like PRINT_ALL, so PRINT_
  prefix is not needed.
* Avoid returning structures, unions and arrays. Use a static buffer and
  pointers since it is better and faster.
* Add clamp, clamp_max and clamp_min macros. Use whenever possible.
* Organize the menu clamp code (e.g. structure with defs and loop).
* Organize vector functions, remove macros, eliminate duplicates (put in
  q_shared.c).
* Add camera rotation and commands for controlling it.
* Compile with more warnings and fix (shadowed decls, etc.).
* Merge common QMAX - non-QMAX code in renderer.
* Merge renderers in executable (and remove re and ri structures).
* Search the code for FIXME and TODO words and change accordingly.

QuDos FIXME list.
==============================================================================

* Ogg Vorbis play is enbaled by default, if you do a ogg_stop and later you 
  do some changes to de renderer (vid resolutions, windowed/fullscreen), it'll
  crash with Seg Fault.

* In SDL Mode, Switching resolutions loses the joystick.
